{"body":"Using libotp\r\n============\r\n\r\nlibotp is a simple java One-time password generator library, which can easily be used to facilitate two-factor authentication in Java applications. \r\nThe library current supports the standard RFC counter based (hotp) and time based (totp) algorithms. Custom OTP providers can also be written by implementing the \r\n*OTPProvider* interface.\r\n\r\nExample\r\n-------\r\n\r\nBelow is an example of generating time-based password\r\n\r\n> OTP.generate(\"12345678\", \"\" + System.currentTimeMillis(), 6, \"totp\")\r\n\r\nFollowing is an example of counter-based password\r\n\r\n> OTP.generate(\"helloworld\", \"2\", 6, \"hotp\")","note":"Don't delete this file!
